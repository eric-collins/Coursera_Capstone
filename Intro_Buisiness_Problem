In this problem, a group of angel investors has tasked my analysis company to determine what types of companies in Daytona Beach, Florida, are trending. 
They want to be able to invest in trending companies to make the most money possible.  They are particularly interested in non-chain coffeehouses, and local breweries/distilleries. 

For data, I will be relying heavily on the Foursquare API, and it’s ‘trending’ calls to make determinations on what is trending in the area.
